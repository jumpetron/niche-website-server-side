                  As for Passepartout, he thought Mr. Fogg’s manoeuvre simply
                  glorious. The captain had said “between eleven and twelve
                  knots,” and the Henrietta confirmed his prediction. How the
                  adventure ended will be seen anon. Aouda was anxious, though
                  she said nothing.
